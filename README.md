# NeoCal

**NeoCal** is a Google Calendar Command Line Interface that allows you to access your Google Calendar(s) from a command line. It uses Google Apps Script platform to build his own data source, making it less complicated to setup than using OAUTH config tokens.

## Installation

You can either install it via `cargo` or download the binaries from GitHub releases.

If you go the `cargo` route, you need to have it installed (usually using [rustup](https://rustup.rs)). In a terminal, run this command to install `neocal`:

```
cargo install neocal
```

Then you'll be able to run `neocal` from whichever directory you're in.
